# [v1.1.0](https://github.com/sreich/android-count-the-days/tree/v1.1.0) (2017-02-19)
* add backup export/import feature, you can now backup to services like google
drive, email, local storage and so on. you won't have to do this unless you're
on Lollipop, in which case please backup manually or a device reset will lose
your data. Other versions (Android M, N), are perfectly fine and automatically
backup, so you don't have to worry about this.

* bugs fixed related to changes not showing up without exiting the app and
reentering. now you don't have to do that, so that's nice.

* clear all now works properly. before this, it did nothing -- we realized that
wasn't too useful.

* there's now a settings page (accessible via 3 dot drop-down), there's also the
'about' section, which you could use to find other ways to contact us. you know,
 if you felt like contacting me for some odd reason...

# [v1.0](https://github.com/sreich/android-count-the-days/tree/v1.0) (2016-10-16)
* initial release
