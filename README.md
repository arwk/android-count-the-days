# android-count-the-days
android project in kotlin to count the days from a time point

I needed an app that would count days since a date and days until. The current apps on the market, even paid ones don't satisfy me. They usually have a backup mechanism that backs up to Dropbox or something awful. But really all they had go do was target marshmallow's SDK level and they get the auto backup and restore for free.

So I made this app. It's also a bit more materialized than other apps.

And of course, I had to make it open source. It's in kotlin because it's awesome, hopefully somebody benefits from the code or the (admittedly niche) featured.
